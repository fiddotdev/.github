# Portals
The Farcaster Development Platform

## What is Portals?
Portals is the Farcaster development platform. 

The future of social protocols revolve around developers permissionlessly building on top of the protocol, and we think that should be a seamless process.

We hate this expression, but in simple terms, think of us as Alchemy for Farcaster.

## What are we building?
We have some super cool announcments in the coming weeks, stay tuned.
